	<h1>After a few weeks of building, The Free State of Ligma's first building site has been completed!</h1>
	<strong>Written by President Aaron Innecco on the 6th of June 2025.</strong>
	<p>In a historic moment for The Free State of Ligma, the first official construction project has been completed, a brand-new road, marking a significant step toward development and connectivity within the nation. Once a mere construction site, this newly paved route now stands as a symbol of progress.</p>

	<p>The construction site started out as a huge field with a rocky side on one side, and tall grass on the other, this is where the first base was created, and the idea of "taking over" the area was founded. 5 years after the construction site became a thing, they then began to build, destroying the first base. It took a while, but eventually, houses 38A, 38B, 38C and 38D were created (keep in mind that this was before the Free State of Ligma was a thing). After that, no one went into the construction site for a while, until we started back up again, with the MANCATS Movement. The name derives from the first names of (most of) the members, excluding Ois√≠n Keely as his name made it hard for us create a word out of our names. We continued to occupy the construction site, attempting to place a dead tree in the ground and buty it, making a flag-pole, and also attempting to make a bomb shelter out of a rusted metal fence with rocks on top for camoflauge. Then on the 5th of April, 2025, the declaration of independance commenced, where the President, Aaron Innecco, used an android tablet and a bluetooth speaker to play a pre-recorded announcement of independance, while also putting up the signed document. this marked the start of a new country.</p>

	<p>The builders then started working on the site a little bit later, with the goal of creating a road from Finlay Park to around the area of Applegreen, Jigginstown. It took around 2 weeks, but they finally did it, except, they didn't. The road only spanned across the original construction site's area, meaning they still didnt pave over the River of Four Men, or the Farmer's Field, but this marks a historical milestone for The Free State of Ligma, and all it's citizens.</p>
